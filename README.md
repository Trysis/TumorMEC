# Extracellular Matrix in a Tumor Microenvironment

The goal of this project is to identify features correlated with tumor immune cell infiltration based on the extracellular matrix organization.

Supervised by Hélène MOREAU (helene.moreau@curie.fr), Paolo PIEROBON (paolo.pierobon@inserm.fr), Zoe FUSILIER (zoe.fusilier@curie.fr) and Adriana LECOURIEUX (lecourieuxadriana@gmail.com).  

This project was made for the Master 2 Bioinformatics course in Université Paris Cité.  

## Context
The extracellular matrix (ECM), which constitutes the architecture of tissues, is drastically modified during tumorigenesis. These modifications support tumor growth and facilitate metastasis but also limits the immune response against the tumor, in particular by trapping immune cells in the capsula of collagen fibers surrounding tumor islets.
