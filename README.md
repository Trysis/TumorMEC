# TumorMEC
The extracellular matrix (ECM), which constitutes the architecture of tissues, is drastically modified during tumorigenesis. These modifications support tumor growth and facilitate metastasis but also limits the immune response against the tumor, in particular by trapping immune cells in the capsula of collagen fibers surrounding tumor islets.
